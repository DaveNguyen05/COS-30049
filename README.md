# COS-30049_Computing_Technology_Innovation_Project
This is a project-based unit where students collaborate in teams to develop innovative solutions for industry challenges. The primary focus is to apply a range of IT techniques and analysis methods to effectively address these challenges.
The goal is for students to learn how to complete a real-world project from scratch, similar to what industrial professionals do daily.
### A few files and folders are missing from the Assignment 3 folder (because they are too large to upload). So, if you download it and try to run it with React.js, it won't work!
### If you need to access the whole Assignment 3 folder, please contact me via [email](davenguyen2k5@gmail.com).
### This course requires a lot of collaboration, therefore my team report and codes are only reference resources!
### Do not attempt to copy my team works in any way, your Convenor of the Unit will know!
